        <h2>About JustFilm:</h1>
        <p>JustFilm is a website inspired by Korean photo booths.
        As someone who is obsessed with taking photo booth pictures with
        friends and family, I wanted to create a website inspired by one!
        JustFilm was created to feel like a physical photo booth, with a
        countdown before each photo, photo capturing sounds, frame design
        options, and photo printing (downloading) sounds!
        Use JustFilm with your friends and family to capture fun moments
        and choose one of the 8 custom frame options to pair with it.
        Download your photo strip to keep in your photo gallery and
        share with whoever you would like.
        </p>
